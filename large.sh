<< comment
The provided code is a shell script written in Bash (Bourne Again Shell) that compares two numbers entered by the user and prints which one is greater. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. Shebang Line (#!/bin/sh):

This line specifies that the script should be run using the /bin/sh interpreter, a common Bourne shell interpreter.
2. User Input:

echo "Enter two numbers ": This line prints a message prompting the user to enter two numbers.
read n1: This line reads the user's input and stores it in the variable n1. This variable will hold the first number entered.
read n2: This line reads the user's input for the second number and stores it in the variable n2.
3. Comparison and Printing:

if [ $n1 -gt $n2 ]: This line initiates an if statement that checks if the value in n1 is greater than the value in n2.
[]: This is a command-line syntax for performing comparisons in Bash.
-gt: This operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
then: If the condition $n1 -gt $n2 is true (i.e., n1 is greater than n2), the code block indented below then executes.
echo $n1 "is greater": This line prints the value stored in n1 followed by the text "is greater".
else: If the condition $n1 -gt $n2 is false (i.e., n1 is less than or equal to n2), the code block indented below else executes.
echo $n2 "is greater": This line prints the value stored in n2 followed by the text "is greater".
4. Script Termination:

The script doesn't have an explicit termination statement. Once the if statement's logic concludes (either the then or else block executes), the script reaches the end and exits.
