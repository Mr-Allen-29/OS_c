The provided code is a Bash shell script that determines whether a given year is a leap year. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. Shebang Line (#!/bin/sh):

This line specifies that the script should be run using the /bin/sh interpreter, a common Bourne shell interpreter.
2. User Input:

echo "Enter a year": This line prompts the user to enter a year.

read y: This line reads the user's input and stores it in the variable y.

3. Leap Year Check:

The script uses an if statement with a complex condition to check for leap years.
if [ $((y%4)) -eq 0 ] || [ $((y%400)) -eq 0 ] && [ $((y%100)) -ne 0 ]: This entire condition determines if the year is a leap year. Let's break it down:
$((y%4)): This part calculates the remainder when y is divided by 4 and stores the result.
-eq 0: This checks if the remainder is equal to 0 (zero).
||: This is the logical OR operator.
$((y%400)) -eq 0: This part checks if the remainder when y is divided by 400 is equal to 0.
&&: This is the logical AND operator.
[ $((y%100)) -ne 0 ]: This part checks if the remainder when y is divided by 100 is not equal to 0 (i.e., not a multiple of 100).
Explanation of Leap Year Logic:

A year is a leap year if:
It's divisible by 4 (except for the special cases below). OR
It's divisible by 400 (to account for centuries that are multiples of 100 but not 400).
4. Printing the Result:

then: If the overall condition in the if statement is true (i.e., the year is a leap year based on the logic above), the code block indented below then executes.

echo "leap year": This line prints a message indicating the year is a leap year.
else: If the condition in the if statement is false (i.e., the year is not a leap year), the code block indented below else executes.

echo "not leap": This line prints a message indicating the year is not a leap year.
5. Script Termination:

Similar to the previous scripts, there's no explicit termination statement. Once the conditional logic concludes (executing either the then or else block), the script reaches the end and exits.

Summary:

This Bash script effectively determines leap years by implementing the standard leap year rules using arithmetic operations (modulo - %) and logical operators (AND - &&, OR - ||) within a conditional statement. It provides a clear way to check for leap years based on user input.
