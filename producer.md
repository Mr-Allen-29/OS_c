The provided C code simulates a producer-consumer problem using semaphores to synchronize access to a shared buffer. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. Header Inclusions:

<stdio.h>: Provides standard input/output functions (e.g., printf).
<stdlib.h>: Provides general utility functions (not directly used here).
2. Semaphore Variables:

mutex = 1: This integer variable acts as a mutual exclusion semaphore. It's initialized to 1, allowing only one process (producer or consumer) to enter the critical section (accessing the buffer) at a time.
full = 0: This integer variable acts as a semaphore to track the number of full slots in the buffer. It's initialized to 0, assuming the buffer is empty initially (3 empty slots).
empty = 3: This integer variable acts as a semaphore to track the number of empty slots in the buffer. It's initialized to 3, indicating all 3 slots are initially empty.
3. Semaphore Functions:

int signal(int s): This function simulates a semaphore signal operation. It increments the value of the provided semaphore variable s by 1.
int wait(int s): This function simulates a semaphore wait operation. It decrements the value of the provided semaphore variable s by 1, but with a check. If the value of s is already 0 (no resources available), the process waits until the semaphore becomes non-zero (signaled).
4. Producer Function:

void producer(): This function simulates a producer process that adds an item to the buffer.
mutex = wait(mutex): Acquires the mutex semaphore, ensuring exclusive access to the critical section (buffer operations).
full = signal(full): Increments full to indicate one more item is in the buffer (assuming successful addition).
empty = wait(empty): Decrements empty to indicate one less empty slot (assuming successful addition). This wait might block the producer if there are no empty slots (empty is 0).
printf("Buffer contains %d items\n", full): Prints the current number of items in the buffer after the addition.
mutex = signal(mutex): Releases the mutex semaphore, allowing other processes to access the critical section.
5. Consumer Function:

void consumer(): This function simulates a consumer process that removes an item from the buffer.
mutex = wait(mutex): Acquires the mutex semaphore for exclusive access.
empty = signal(empty): Increments empty to indicate one more empty slot is available (assuming successful removal).
full = wait(full): Decrements full to indicate one less item in the buffer (assuming successful removal). This wait might block the consumer if the buffer is empty (full is 0).
printf("Buffer contains %d items\n", full): Prints the current number of items in the buffer after the removal.
mutex = signal(mutex): Releases the mutex semaphore.
6. Main Function:

int main(): This function is the program's entry point.
int n: An integer variable to store the user's choice.
An infinite loop (while(1)) keeps the program running until the user exits.
Prompts the user to choose between producer, consumer, or exit.
Reads the user's choice using scanf.
A switch statement handles different choices:
case 1 (producer): Checks if the mutex is available (1) and there's an empty slot (empty is not 0). If so, the producer function is called to add an item. Otherwise, a message indicates the buffer is full.
case 2 (consumer): Checks if the mutex is available (1) and there's at least one item (full is not 0). If so, the consumer function is called to remove an item. Otherwise, a message indicates the buffer is empty.
case 3 (exit): Exits the program with exit(0).
Summary:

This code demonstrates the use of semaphores for synchronization in a producer-consumer scenario. The mutex semaphore ensures exclusive access to the buffer, while full and empty semaphores track buffer occupancy and availability. The code prevents race conditions and data corruption by ensuring proper coordination between producer and consumer processes.
