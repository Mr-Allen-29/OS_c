The provided code is a Bash shell script that compares three numbers entered by the user and determines the greatest number. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. Shebang Line (#!/bin/sh):

This line specifies that the script should be run using the /bin/sh interpreter, a common Bourne shell interpreter.
2. User Input:

echo "Enter three numbers ": This line prints a message prompting the user to enter three numbers.
Three read commands (read n1, read n2, and read n3) are used to read the user's input for each number and store them in separate variables: n1, n2, and n3.
3. Conditional Checks for Largest Number:

The script uses an if-elif-else structure to determine the largest number.
if [ $n1 -gt $n2 ] && [ $n1 -gt $n3 ]: This if statement checks if n1 is greater than both n2 and n3 using two conditions joined by the && (AND) operator.
[ $n1 -gt $n2 ]: This part checks if n1 is greater than n2.
&& [ $n1 -gt $n3 ]: This part checks additionally if n1 is also greater than n3.
If both conditions are true (i.e., n1 is the largest), the code block indented below then executes.
elif [ $n2 -gt $n1 ] && [ $n2 -gt $n3 ]: This elif (else if) statement is only considered if the previous if condition was false. It checks if n2 is greater than both n1 and n3.
Similar to the if condition, both parts need to be true for the elif block to execute.
If n2 is the largest, the code indented below then in the elif block executes.
else: If neither the if nor the elif condition is true (meaning both n1 and n2 are not the largest), the code block indented below else executes. This implies n3 must be the largest.
4. Printing the Largest Number:

Within each code block (then of if, then of elif, or else):
echo $nX "is greater" (where X is 1, 2, or 3): This line prints the value stored in the corresponding variable (n1, n2, or n3) followed by the text "is greater". The specific variable used depends on which condition was true.
5. Script Termination:

Similar to the previous script, there's no explicit termination statement. Once the conditional logic concludes (executing either the if, elif, or else block), the script reaches the end and exits.

Summary:

This Bash script effectively takes three numbers as input, compares them using conditional statements, and prints the largest number along with a message. It demonstrates the use of an if-elif-else structure for handling multiple conditions and determining the greatest value among three variables.
