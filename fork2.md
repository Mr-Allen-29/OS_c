The provided C code demonstrates process creation using the fork system call and includes improvements for clarity and determinism:

Explanation:

Header Inclusions:

<stdio.h>: Includes functions for standard input/output, like printf.
<unistd.h>: Provides POSIX operating system functions, including fork.
<stdlib.h>: Often included with unistd.h, but not directly used here (may contain general utility functions).
<sys/types.h>: Includes system data types like pid_t (used for process IDs).
forkexample Function:

This function encapsulates the process creation logic.
if (fork() == 0) { ... } else { ... }: This conditional statement uses the return value of fork to determine whether the code is executing in the parent process or the child process:
Parent Process:
fork returns the process ID (PID) of the newly created child process.
The code inside the else block executes in the parent process. It prints "Hello from Parent".
Child Process:
fork returns 0 (zero) in the child process.
The code inside the if block executes in the child process. It prints "Hello from Child".
main Function:

The program's entry point.
forkexample(): This line calls the forkexample function, which creates a new process using fork and prints messages from both parent and child.
Key Points:

By separating the process creation logic into a function, the code becomes more organized and reusable.
This version ensures that "Hello from Parent" is always printed before "Hello from Child" because the parent process calls the function first and then waits for the child to finish (implicit in a simple fork without synchronization).
Execution Flow:

The main function starts in the parent process.
It calls forkexample().
The forkexample function calls fork().
A child process is created.
The code within forkexample diverges based on the return value of fork:
Parent Process: Prints "Hello from Parent".
Child Process: Prints "Hello from Child".
Both parent and child processes terminate.
Example Output:

Hello from Parent
Hello from Child
Advantages of this Approach:

Improved code organization and readability.
More deterministic behavior in the output order compared to the previous versions.
Additional Notes:

For more complex process interactions and synchronization, you'd use advanced techniques like wait system calls or other IPC mechanisms.
