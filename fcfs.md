The provided C code calculates the Average Waiting Time (AWT) and Average Turnaround Time (ATT) for a set of processes considering a non-preemptive scheduling scenario (FCFS - First Come, First Served). It assumes that all processes arrive at time zero. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Header Inclusion:

#include<stdio.h>: This line includes the standard input/output library, providing functions like printf for printing and scanf for user input.
2. main Function:

This is the program's entry point where execution begins.
3. Variable Declarations:

p[5]: An integer array to store the burst times of up to 5 processes.
bt, ta: Integer variables (not used in the current implementation).
wt[5]: An integer array to store the waiting times for each process.
n: An integer variable to store the total number of processes entered by the user.
ct[5]: An integer array to store the completion times for each process.
tat[5]: An integer array to store the turnaround times for each process.
twt: A floating-point variable to store the total waiting time.
ttat: A floating-point variable to store the total turnaround time.
4. User Input for Number of Processes:

printf prompts the user to enter the total number of processes.
scanf reads the user's input and stores it in the n variable.
5. Input Burst Times:

A loop iterates from 0 to n-1:
printf displays a message asking for the burst time of process P[i].
scanf reads the user's input for the burst time and stores it in the p[i] array element.
6. Calculate Completion Times:

bt is initialized to the burst time of the first process (p[0]).
A loop iterates from 0 to n-1:
The completion time of process i is calculated by adding the previous process's completion time (ct[i-1]) (which starts at bt) to the current process's burst time (p[i]) and stored in ct[i].
7. Calculate Waiting Times:

A loop iterates from 0 to n-1:
The waiting time of process i is calculated by subtracting its burst time (p[i]) from its completion time (ct[i]) and stored in wt[i].
8. Calculate Turnaround Times:

A loop iterates from 0 to n-1:
The turnaround time of process i is calculated by subtracting its burst time (p[i]) from its completion time (ct[i]) and stored in tat[i].
9. Print Process Table:

printf displays a table header with columns for Process, Burst Time (BT), Completion Time (CT), Turn Around Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT).
A loop iterates from 0 to n-1:
printf displays a row for each process, showing its ID, burst time, completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time.
10. Calculate Total Turnaround Time and Waiting Time:

Loops iterate to calculate the total waiting time (twt) and total turnaround time (ttat) by summing the corresponding elements in the wt and tat arrays, respectively.
11. Calculate Average Waiting Time and Turnaround Time:

avg (average waiting time) is calculated by dividing twt (total waiting time) by n (number of processes).
avgt (average turnaround time) is calculated by dividing ttat (total turnaround time) by n (number of processes).
12. Print Results:

printf statements display the calculated Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time.
This code effectively calculates the AWT and ATT for a set of processes under FCFS scheduling. If you have any further questions about the code or its functionality, feel free to ask!
